## My schedule $\blue {\tiny \textbf{\quad current status : ver. 2023/02/19}}$

### Feb 18

- progress: read all slides from [M01](), pp. 1-40
- installed Racket (I will largely refer to this guy as rkt from now on)
- `error launching installer` ($\because$ language setting, fixed)
- `error failure cannot load the dll` ($\because$ desktop shortcut pathway, fixed)
- output field looks like this:
	```
	Welcome to DrRacket, version 8.8 [cs].
	Language: No language chosen; memory limit: 128 MB.
	DrRacket cannot process programs until you choose a programming language.
	Either select the “Choose Language…” item in the “Language” menu, or get guidance.
	> 
	```
- a side note: `;` or `;;` comments a single line out
- every time when changing the language, 
	- go to the Language tab and select Choose Language, 
	- select level under Teaching Languages, 
	- click the Show Details button in the bottom left, and
	- under Constant Style, select true false empty
- programming language designs
	- imperative: based on frequent changes to data, e.g. Java/C++/VB6
	- functional: based on the computation of new values rather than the old ones, e.g. Excel/Mathematica/Racket
- empirically speaking, `design = ad-hoc + technique`
- some terms regarding functions
	- name $\sim g,f$
	- parameters $\sim x,y$
	- algebraic expression $\sim x+y, x^2$
	- application $\sim g(1,3)$
	- arguments may themselves be applications $\sim g(g(1,3),f(2))=g(4,f(2))=g(4,4)=8$
- conversion of algebraic expressions from math to rkt: conventions
	- when we have a choice of possible substitutions, we <u>take the leftmost one and proceed from left to right</u>
	- we only apply a function when <u>all of its arguments are values</u> not general expressions
	- still that one example, $g(g(1,3),f(2))=g(4,f(2))=g(4,4)=8$
	- spaces between any infix operators `/ * + -` and operands $1\ 1\ 4\ 5\ 1\ 4$ etc.
	- extra parentheses are harmful in rkt
- DrRacket environment
	- interactions and definitions windows
	- REPL (read-evaluate-print loop)
- use `#true, #false, '()` in rkt instead of `true, false, empty`
- numbers
	- integers: unbounded
	- rational numbers: represented exactly
	- irrational numbers: flagged as being inexact
- define functions
	- `(define (g x y) (+ x y))` $\Leftrightarrow g(x,y)=x+y$
	- `(define (f x) (* x x))` $\Leftrightarrow f(x)=x^2$
- an operation: $(g\ (g\ 1\ 3)\ (f\ 2)) ⇒ (g\ (+\ 1\ 3)\ (f\ 2)) ⇒ (g\ 4\ (f\ 2)) ⇒ (g\ 4\ (∗\ 2\ 2)) ⇒ (g\ 4\ 4) ⇒ (+\ 4\ 4) ⇒ 8$
- define const.
	- `(define k 3)` $\Leftrightarrow k=3$, binds the name $k$ to the value $3$
	- `(define p (* k k))` $\Leftrightarrow p=k^2$, evaluates $k^2$ and $p$ is bound to that value
- advantages of const. (trivial)
- always remember to <u>first evaluate, then do the algebraic operations</u>, e.g.
	```
	(define x 3)
	(define (f x y) (- x y))
	(+ x x) ; = (+ 3 x) = (+ 3 3) = 6
	(f 7 6) ; = (- 7 6) = 1
	(f 5 x) ; = (f 5 3) = (- 5 3) = 2
	```

### Feb 19
- progress: read slides from [M02]() (up to p. 23), read HtDP sec. 1-5, done [A01]() + [A02]()
- HtDP, sections 1-5 reading notes attached [here]()
- design recipe: use it for EVERY function written in CS135
	- components
		- purpose: what the function does
		- contract: what type of arguments supplied and values produced
		- examples: typical use of the function
		- definition: rkt header and body of the function
		- tests: a <u>representative</u> set of inputs and outputs
	- order of carrying out these steps
		- write a draft of purpose
		- write examples by hand, and then code them
		- write definition header and contract
		- finalize the purpose with parameter names
		- write definition body
		- write tests: DO NOT figure out the expected answers to your tests by running your program! Always work them out by hand.
	- example:
		```
		;; PURPOSE. (sum-of-squares p1 p2) produces the sum of the squares of p1 and p2
		;; CONTRACT. sum-of-squares: Num Num → Num
		;; EXAMPLES.
		(check-expect (sum-of-squares 3 4) 25)
		(check-expect (sum-of-squares 0 2.5) 6.25)
		;; DEFINITION. header and body:
		(define (sum-of-squares p1 p2) (+ (* p1 p1) (* p2 p2)))
		;; TESTS.
		(check-expect (sum-of-squares 0 0) 0)
		(check-expect (sum-of-squares -2 7) 53)
		```
