# My materials
Here are some things I've written. Quite a few of these are written in [dylanadi.sty](https://github.com/Yu-Dylan/tex/tree/master/dylanadi), my personal LaTeX style file.[^fn1]

## Math
I've divided the handouts into levels:
- 0 for unrated,
- 1 for introductory AMC 8 and below,
- 2 for AIME and below,
- 3 for easy USA(J)MO and below, and
- 4 for everything else.

### Level 0
- [Properties of 2020](/files/handouts/M0-prop2020.pdf): A list of properties of 2020 made by scouring [OEIS](https://oeis.org/). Also check out [this handout by Walt S](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-sKnKOWUNaZAfG_4o1DaHoVAwnNQ9PWp/view), which is better suited for AMC practice.

### Level 1

### Level 2
- [AIME Strategies](/files/handouts/M2-aime.pdf): A few strategies for AIME preparation. You can consider this a sequel to the [BOGTRO's article](https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c5h1061437p4596291).
- [Diagram Perturbation](/files/handouts/M2-perturb.pdf): Slick geometric transformation problems that feel like you're building something on top of the existing figure.
- [Hidden Gems](/files/handouts/M2-gems.pdf): Some problems that don't get the love they deserve; many are taken from David Altizio's collection.

### Level 3
- [Unorthodox Problems](/files/handouts/M3-unorthodox.pdf): A few problems that aren't like others. Have fun solving! **Note:** I no longer think all of these problems are unorthodox. All of them are a lot of fun to do though!
- [Diophantine Equations](/files/handouts/M3-diophantine.pdf): Basic techniques to solving diophantines, like modular arithmetic, inequalities, etc.
- [Invariants](/files/handouts/M3-invariants.pdf): How to use quantities that don't change to solve problems.
- [Roots of Unity Filter](https://www.nicecontest.xyz/static/media/NJ2.942d32c0.pdf): Written with Raymond Feng for NICE Journal, of which I am the lead editor. See [the website](https://www.nicecontest.xyz/) for other issues.

### Level 4
- [Integration](https://www.geometryexplorer.xyz/pdfs/calc/integration.pdf): Co-written with Dennis Chen. Covers various methods of integration.

## Computer science

### Level 0
- [LaTeX Basics](/files/handouts/I0-latex.pdf): Slides presented for my school's CS club. Covers the fundamentals of LaTeX, e.g. common commands and structures.
- [HTML Basics](/posts/html-tutorial/): Short blog post going over the very basics of HTML.
- [Markdown Basics](/posts/markdown-tutorial/): Short blog post going over the very basics of Markdown.

# Euclid's Orchard
In 2020, I banded together with a group of students to write some handouts intended for the [AoPS](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) community. Here is our work.

## General
- [One Page Summaries (unfinished)](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-onepagers.pdf): Written by me. This was a project to condense one topic into one page by picking what we thought was important. This is by no means a comprehensive guide -- it is one page after all! **Note:** The project is unfinished and there are currently no plans to finish it.

## AMC-AIME Level
- [Recursion in the AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-recursion.pdf): Written by Jeffrey Chen, with edits by Peter Pu. A nice introductory handout to the idea of forming and solving recursions.
- [Modular Arithmetic in the AMC and AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-mods.pdf): Written by me to introduce modular arithmetic. Goes over most concepts in modular arithmetic, although some overlapping topics with other parts of number theory may have been left out.
- [Sequences and Series in the AMC and AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-sequences.pdf): Written by nikenissan and me. Covers arithmetic, geometric, arithmetico-geometric, telescoping, and recursive sequences. Note that recursive sequences is briefly mentioned, since we already have an article on recursion.

## AIME-USA(J)MO Level
- [Polynomials in the AIME](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-polynomials.pdf): Written by naman12 and me. A complete guide on how to use polynomials on the AIME. Includes (almost) every polynomial problem on the AIME and also problems from other sources (such as RMO and HMMT).
- [Standard Proof Techniques](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-proofs.pdf): Written by Jai Sharma. Introduces proof techniques any olympiad student should know.
- [Trigonometry in the AIME and USA(J)MO](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-trigonometry.pdf): Written by naman12 and me. A complete guide on how to use trigonometry on the AIME and USA(J)MO. Includes (almost) every trigonometry problem on the AIME, with worked out problems as well as more than one hundred hints to selected problems. There are quite a few olympiad problems sprinkled in, too.

## Higher Math
- [Group Theory](/files/handouts/orchard/orchard-grouptheory.pdf): Written by Emma Cardwell and Matthew Ho. It is an introductory piece covering the basic ideas of group theory.

# Footnotes
[^fn1]: An error will occur if you try to use it with the 2020 version of TeX (because the Merriweather font code was changed to `MerriwthrSans-OsF`), so please use the 2021 version! (Why would you want to use an older version anyway?)
