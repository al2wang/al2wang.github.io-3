<center> <b> Among the Evergreen </b> </center>
  \\
The canyon stood defiantly in front of me,\\
A hole but a wall, immovable, carved out through millions of years\\
By something as simple as water\\
Yet so indescribably permanent\\
This canyon, carved by a knife of the gods into the Jasper forest\\
Is an anomaly, yet it is but one of so many features\\
In this vast national park\\
All around me I see massive, intimidating cliffs of rock\\
Standing in the way of any living creatureâ€™s path,\\
The whole forest an obstacle course,\\
An impossible challenge to be attempted\\
But never overcome\\
Nothing overcomes this land except\\
The evergreen\\
Jutting out of cliff faces and barely suspended rocks\\
Stubbornly refusing to die\\
In the grey, dead, unforgiving stone\\
Remaining a wonderful green, against the bitter mountain cold\\
This population of trees lies alone facing\\
One of the harshest environments on Earth,\\
And yet they thrive\\
And create an environment of their own\\
I wonder what it would be like\\
To be lost in this familiar alien world,\\
An incredible land of\\
Wonder and dread,\\
Peace and anxiety,\\
Calm and chaos and contentedness,\\
Teaming with every emotion and so full of life,\\
And yet so dull, so pale,\\
A blank sheet\\
Devoid of life, say for the endless evergreen\\
The landscape and its life, which existed before me\\
And will exist long after me\\
A place where I may only watch as we both grow old, but I will rot away and it will remain\\
Unchanged and ready to bring awe and anguish to generations\\
I will never know\\
I long to be among the evergreen, but I will never be one with it\\
I must simply be with it\\
A man\\
Against the immeasurable\\
