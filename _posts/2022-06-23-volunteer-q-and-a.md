## Question

Write a brief personal statement, describing what you feel you have gained as a result of completing the program, and what your plans are for the future.

## Reflection

### Achievements (and things I am good at)

One of the good things I feel like bragging a little bit here, is that I viewed reflections (or, diaries or logs) as revisiting experiences in order to help me understand myself. After critically reflecting on each session, I was able to not only recognize my abilities and strengths but also highlight my skills that are lacking. Through reflections, I could then focus on improving these skills. I had many goals before starting my volunteering, and the main one was to develop my professional behavior, walking little kids through the basics of English reading and writing and motivating them by actively interacting with them through dialogues and ice-breaking activities in English. Thinking about professors giving a lecture on the rostrum literally piqued my interests in volunteer teaching. I was also intrigued to see if I enjoyed working with children as we will be focusing on middle school-level English for children in Grade 4. Previously, my biggest worry was that I couldn’t clarify a concept clearly and that I would feel embarrassed, but finally it turned out to be really fluent. To be honest, I was kind of surprised to see how I was fully capable to crack an obscure concept with the dumbed down explanations.

### Things I need to improve

I figure that I might be falling short of a more effective way of organizing what I want to teach, or better communication, when interacting with both my advisors and my little students. Another seemingly imperfect facet is my deficit of a sense of humor in flashing out the teaching contents. In some shared videos labeled as “models,” I note they all made it to try their best to let students have so much fun as possible when teaching new things. I will definitely be striving to improve them on the lookout.

### Thoughts and future plans

My volunteering as a teacher, who imparts English knowledge to little kids, in my view, is an example of service learning. I always stick to the core notion of “service” in the process, just as what Mahatma Gandhi once pointed out, “the best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” This is why volunteering was a not only educational but also refreshing experience for me, besides organizing school club workshops and rallies. On top of this, it is impossible to overlook the fact that the suggestions proposed by my kind ASDAN instructors and my reflections after each session really benefit me a lot. I also want to thank my student, Pei’en, for his conscientiousness and patience showed in all six lessons and homework. In the near future, I will be sure to enroll in a university and, in pursuit of the spirit of serving and contribution, to sign up for a TA (stands for Teaching Assistant) position, in order to help more and more students with attaining our common dream of becoming a scientist (or, an excellent worker in the job industry).
