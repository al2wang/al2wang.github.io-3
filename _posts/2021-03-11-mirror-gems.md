<center> Inspired by mirror neurons </center>

	Half past nine. In the residential area, blocks of yellow and orange light framed by windows were quietly arrayed along the tall buildings. In one dim orange block, a young girl was lying in her bed, accompanied by an old lady sitting at her bedside.
  
	“Granny, Granny, one last story, and I’ll sleep,” the girl shook her Granny’s arm, little drowsiness in her eyes.
  
	“Okay, my sweetie, but this is really the last one, I’m a bit tired,” smiled the old woman benignly. “Have I told you the story of the goat with one eye?”
  
	“You have. I want a brand-new story, Granny.”
  
	“What about the Sleepy Witch?”
  
	“You have told that for three times, Granny,” the girl curled her lip discontentedly.
  
	“Well, I am sorry. Old people are like this. I haven’t told you the story of Mirror Gems, right?”
  
	The girl nodded with satisfaction, closing her eyes with expectation.
  
	“Long long ago, there was a unique race, a race without feelings. Each member lived in a tall tower far from others. These creatures were generated in their tower alone; they grew up alone; they spent their whole life alone in the tower. They never ventured farther than several miles from the tower. When one died, the tower generated another one to be the new host of the tower. There was always one host of the tower, yet only one. In these creatures’ whole lives, they lived freely in their own styles, contributing to the development of the tower in their own ways. Those that were good at hunting might leave the descendants notes on how to be a better hunter, and those that were interested in cooking might leave piles of cookbooks. Generations of scientists and engineers could even slowly transform the tower into a mechanical castle.”
  
	“I like this setting. But wouldn’t they feel lonely? Why didn’t they communicate with others?”
  
	“Since they had no feelings, they did not need to worry about feeling lonely. These creatures did communicate with each other, but the communications were always long-distance and short. And few of these creatures attempted to travel through the dense fog circling the towers.”
  
	“But there must be one that does that eventually,” the girl commented, eyes open, proud of her knowledge about stories.
  
	“Yes, yes, but be patient, my sweetie,” said the old woman, smiling.
  
	“Our protagonist was an unprecedentedly successful and talented businessman who traded with hundreds of towers around. He luckily received a legacy of a map about the region and the technology of making mechanical eagles, which he used as couriers.”
  
	“One day, when he was having breakfast on the first floor of the tower, a strange knock on the door frightened him. He resorted to the monitor and saw an exhausted, shabby man standing at the door.”
  
	“‘Help! I need some food and water, you benevolent host!’ the man outside the door cried in a hoarse voice. After checking that the unexpected guest did not bring anything dangerous with him, our protagonist let him in and offered him a substantial breakfast.”
  
	“Ha! Here comes the hero that traveled through the fog,” said the little girl.
  
	Smiling, the old woman kept on with the story.
  
  “After the meal, the two men went to the living room and sat on the sofa. The guest, who called himself Wade, began to tell about his adventure in a boastful way: He used to be an idler. After he found an adventure diary written by his short-lived last generation under the bed, he began reading it to kill time.”
  
  “‘There starts my misfortune,’ cried Wade.”
  
  “So---he is not a hero,” commented the girl, curious.
  
  “After finishing the diary, Wade felt bored about the changeless life in the tower again, so he planned to travel through the fog around his tower to see if the world is indeed so colorful as the diary suggested. He used several weeks to build a go-anywhere vehicle and crammed it with food and other necessities. Then he started his journey, for the first time seeing the landscape outside of the fog. Excited by the new world outside, he decided to follow the steps of his last generation. So far, he had driven through a large savanna, chasing antelope for fun. He had lain at the edge of a cliff, staring at the magnificent sunset glowing in the chilly winds. He had climbed the highest tree in a forest, being pecked by a mother bird.”
  
  “Wait, did he know anything about such stuff like boredom, fun, or excitement? I remember you have said his race has no idea of feelings,” rejected the girl.
  
  “Yes, you are right, darling. That is not common, and our protagonist noticed it too.”
  
  “‘What do you mean?’ asked our host. ‘What’s the meaning of “bored”, “excited”, and – yeah, “boring”. Is your tower on the verge of creating a new language? Also, of course the world is colorful, even within the fog. See, the sofa is purple, the door is gray, and my shirt is blue. Besides, I don’t think there is any meaning of wasting your petroleum to chase after anything except for food, and staying in the wind causes rapid loss of heat, so you need to eat more; so does climbing the highest tree ... hey, I really don’t understand ... Or perhaps there is something wrong with your brain? One of my ancestors had some achievements in medicine . . . perhaps electricity will help . . .’”
  
  “‘I’m fine!’ Wade jumped up from the sofa, scared. ‘You don’t understand because you don’t have feelings!’”
  
  “‘What are feelings?’ asked the host, confused.”
  
“Wade thought for a moment, then he replied: ‘Feelings are a special way to sense the world. They imbue actions with meanings – hey, good guy, what’s your name? We have talked for so long, yet I still don’t know your name.’”
“‘My name? My name is Aidan.’”
“‘Aidan, little fire, the bringer of fire, that’s a good name. What’s your favorite thing?’”
“‘Favorite?’”
“‘I mean . . . what do you spend most of your time on?’”
“‘Doing business.’”
“‘Hey, so you are Aidan The Trader, your eagle couriers look pretty convenient . . .’”
“‘We were talking about feelings, I suppose,’ Aidan broke in.”
The little girl giggled in her bed. “You are really good at playing multiple roles, Granny.
“Ha, your Granny was one of the most famous actresses when she was young.”
“Story, Granny!”
“Okay. . . where were we? Oh, yeah. Wade continued to teach Aidan about the meaning of ‘feelings’. Wade asked: ‘You spend most of your day doing business, but have you ever thought about why you do business?’”
“‘To have more resources and live better, of course.’”
“‘But why do you need these extra resources? Why do you want to live better?’”
“‘Well . . .’”
“‘Feelings are exactly what tell you the answers to these questions.’”
“‘Then how can I know what feelings are?’ asked Aidan.”
“Wade grinned mysteriously and proudly, and he slowly explained how he, one member of the race without feeling, got to know the meaning of feelings.”
The little girl’s eyes popped.
“That was a present from his last generation, that short-lived adventurer. That man left Wade a present – a small hexagonal gem. Wade showed Aidan his precious gem, which he tied with a string and wore as a necklace.”
“Granny! You are being lazy with imagination!” cried the girl, discontent. She sat up from the bed, punching it angrily. She wore a light-yellow night slip dress. In the gentle summer night wind, the glass-like hexagon embedded in the flesh below her collarbones was shining silver gloss. 
“I’m sorry, sweetie, but this is the story,” said Granny patiently, still with her benign smile. 
“Let’s continue our story. The gem, according to the dead adventurer, was called ‘Mirror Gem’, and it was discovered at the bank of the upstream of ‘Mirror River’. These gems were originally gray at the bank. When the adventurer picked up one, the information of feelings ran into his mind, and the gem turned to silver, shining under the sunlight. He could see his face in this now mirror-like stone. The careful adventurer did some other tests with the gem. He found out that when he put the gem away, the gem turned gray again and he strangely lost his idea about feelings; when he picked it back up, the information came back, and the gem shone again. With a gem in hand, he couldn’t light up another gem, but when he threw away the gem, he could light another gem and get exactly the same information.”
“Granny, you talk as if the hexagons in our bodies are mystical,” commented the girl.
Granny smiled. 
“Wade used the gem given by the dead adventurer, so he understood the meaning of feelings. Actually, his last journey was to the Mirror River; yet on his way, unfortunately, his car, along with all of the food and necessities in it, sank into a swamp. He broke the glass to save his life – the only thing he could save in that emergency. He was pained to watch his car, his best friend that had accompanied him for so long on his journey, being gulped by the evil mouth of the swamp; he knew he couldn’t get home unless he received help from another member of his race. Later, he first walked to the Mirror River and saw the carpet of gray, unused Mirror Gems on the bank. He stuffed some into his pocket – still despondent because of the death of his car – and kept walking along the river. Finally, he saw the spire of Aidan’s tower, and he used another three days to cross the barren land covered by thick fog.”
“Hearing all of this, Aidan asked: ‘Can you give me one gem to try?’”
“Wade gave him one without much hesitation. Aidan took over the gem, and the gem lit up in his hand.”
“‘Wade, I think I understand the romance in your travels. The cliff wind, the landscape at the highest tree, the impressive sunset. Oh, even I want to cross the fog now.’”
“‘This is just empathy, one type of feeling. Hey, empathy, mirror, so Mirror Gem is called this name not only because it is mirror-like.’”
“Aidan, as an ambitious businessman, soon came out from the shock and found business opportunities in it. ‘Listen, Wade. Why not make a deal with me. I’ll give you a solid car, some food, and some necessities, as long as you tell me the location of the bank full of Mirror Gems.”
“Granny, then Wade accepted the deal and Aidan made a good business on Mirror Gems, right?” the girl broke in, yawning. “Since the Mirror Gem part, this story has been boring.”
Seeing the sleepiness in her granddaughter’s eyes, the old woman stopped the storytelling. She tucked the girl in and kissed her forehead tenderly.
“Have a good night, darling.” 
Granny turned off the light and left the room.
The sound of running cars permeated the room, like the sound of river flow. 
The real ending is, thought the old lady, more and more people that got feelings could no longer stand the lonely life in towers. More and more people crossed the fog, met each other. They formed relationships, communities, and a new civilization. 
In the summer wind, she put her hand on the gem below her collarbones.
“Thank you, Aidan The Trader,” said the old lady in a low voice, and the words quickly vanished in the wind.
