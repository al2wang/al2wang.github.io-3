Although in the competition syllabus, the basics of mathematics are covered by "Preliminary Application of Calculus" , we need to use far more mathematical skills than calculus in actual problem solving.

In the process of learning mathematics, we need to pay attention to the following points:

Application-oriented, there is no need to stick to the proof process, but you must be able to use it.
In principle, the competition outline is only up to calculus. Therefore, the mathematical techniques used in the national competition (especially the semi-finals) will not be too complicated. However, in the process of writing questions, Taylor expansion, difference equations and other techniques are often used. Generally speaking, if the national competition has super-class knowledge, the formula will be given at the beginning of the book.
Recommend a treasure book: "Advanced Mathematics", Li Zhong, Peking University Press. It is said that the author wrote it specifically for physics students. At present, the high number B of Peking University Institute of Physics is this book.

You can search and buy from Taobao. Here is an electronic version of the volume:

plural#
Vibration and alternating current are used.

Euler's formula.

calculus#
Since we are taking a closed-book exam, we still need to memorize the calculus formulas that should be memorized.

In Wujing, the calculus of basic functions is mainly used, as well as knowledge related to L'Hopital and limits.

There is no need to look at Tongji Gaoshu. Tongji Gaoshu is too long-winded, and the proof takes up a lot of space. There is no need to brush Jimmy Dovic or Xie Huimin. Again, we'll just use it. These two books are basically prepared for the mathematics department. Its difficulty has exceeded the requirements of the physics department of the university.

Gaussian integral#
In thermodynamics, it is often used to find Maxwell's velocity distribution law.

taylor expansion#
The idea of ​​small quantity approximation and reduction is one of the most important ideas in physics. Among them, the Taylor expansion is the mathematical basis of the approximation method.

Matter competition is mainly reflected in various periodic motions, such as simple pendulum, perturbation method and other topics.

Taylor expansion can be regarded as one of the contents of advanced mathematics. First of all, the expansion formula must be memorized. By the way, you can memorize the expansions of several basic functions.

A basic understanding of first-order small quantities, second-order small quantities, etc. is required.

differential equation#
It is mainly used in the treatment of vibration and alternating current. Although it is also possible to memorize the vibration formula directly, it is recommended to learn it. It's not difficult, just bring it in.

Difference Equation/Sequence#
Difference equations are not considered normal advanced mathematics. Its essence is still the number sequence.

In Wujing, it is mainly used to deal with problems such as "one-dimensional" resistance network and "one-dimensional" particle network.

geometry#
Geometry is divided into two main parts

Part of it is a bit of plane geometry conclusion that needs to be used when dealing with some two-dimensional problems, and it is often used as a topic. Therefore, it is very important to learn mathematics well in junior high school.

The other part is analytic geometry. Especially knowledge related to spherical coordinates.

matrix#
In linear algebra we basically only need to learn matrices. The main thing is to use a little bit when solving simple normal modules.

*Spherical Harmonics#
Fundamentals of electrodynamics. A general solution to three-dimensional electrical problems with certain symmetries.
