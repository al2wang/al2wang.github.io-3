Motion analysis software---Tracker

This is the tutorial ...

## Why `Tracker`

When we explore the laws of motion in physics class or do certain scientific gizmos (an umbrella term for all kinds of weird gadgets we've made so far) after class, we often need to measure the motion of the given object, i.e. the change of physical quantities such as position, velocity and acceleration over time. The powerful tool Tracker would be handy under this circumstance.

Tracker is a free video analysis and modeling tool built on the Open Source Physics (OSP) Java framework. It is designed to be used in physics education, so that we can make quantitative or modeling analysis of mechanics videos at any time in class. It could also used to output data and images, and make further statistical analysis and fitting. With Tracker, students can extend physics investigations from classroom to real life.

## Download and Install

Tracker can run on systems such as Windows (yep like on my laptop X1 Carbon), OS X, Linux(32/64-bit). You can download it directly from [the official website](https://physlets.org/tracker/).

## Basic Features

Here are two key features that we've used both in regular AP Physics C and Honors Physics (Physics 1-3 and the January USIYPT training camp):
- Manual and automated object tracking with position, velocity and acceleration overlays and data.
- Model Builder creates kinematic and dynamic models of point mass particles and two-body systems.

## Application

- 1D motion: e.g. uniform accelerated motion and Newton's second law,
- 2D (n-dimension) motion: 
	- Projectile motion
	- N-body problem: e.g. 3D collisions
	- Periodic motion: e.g. spring oscillator, single pendulum, conical pendulum, etc.

## Basic operations

Straight in 6 steps:
1. Open the video you've filmed when carrying out the experiment (such as how mag spheres attract each other, in our pr #3's case);
2. Select frames of interest;
3. Calibrate the video (set scale);
4. Set the origin and coordinate axis tilt;
5. Create mass point, track the object manually or automatically;
6. Analyze data and make fitting.
