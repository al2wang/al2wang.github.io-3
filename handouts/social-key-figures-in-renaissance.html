<li>Subjects have no right to rebel against a king</li>
<li>Anarchism/choas is the worst alternative</li>

<p>John Locke</p>
<ul>
<li>“The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that being all equal and independent, no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions…” (Locke, Second Treatise on Government, 1690)</li>

<li>There are natural laws which should govern human existence
<ul>
<li>ex. all humans are born with a right to their lives, freedom, and property</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<li>
<p>Adam Smith</p>
<ul>
<li>“He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CqMMxsN_7c">invisible hand</a> to promote an end which was no part of his intention.”</li>
<li>Writes <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776)</li>

<li>“If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him.”</li>
<li>“The supposed right of [religious] intolerance is absurd and barbaric. It is the right of the tiger; nay, it is far worse, for tigers do but tear in order to have food, while we rend each other for paragraphs.”</li>
</ul>
